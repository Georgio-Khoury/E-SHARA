# E-S.H.A.R.A. Website

## Electronic Sign-language Hand Augmented Recognition Assistant (إشارة)

This repository contains the code for the E-S.H.A.R.A. project website, which showcases our innovative sign language interpretation glove system.

## Project Overview

E-S.H.A.R.A. is a wearable technology solution designed to break communication barriers between deaf and hearing individuals. The system translates sign language to speech and speech to visual cues in real-time, supporting both American Sign Language (ASL) and Arabic Sign Language (ArSL).

## Website Structure

The website is structured with the following sections:

1. **Hero Section**: Introduction to E-S.H.A.R.A. with a tagline and brief description
2. **Our Story**: Background of the project and team
3. **Features**: Key capabilities of the E-S.H.A.R.A. system
4. **Technology**: Technical details about the sensor system and how it works
5. **Design**: 3D design and physical construction of the glove
6. **Journey**: Timeline of the project development
7. **Demo**: Video demonstration of the system in action
8. **Testimonials**: Feedback from users and community members # TO BE ADDED
9. **CONTACT**: Contact information and next steps

## Missing Elements

### Images
The following images need to be added to the website:
- High-quality photos of the E-S.H.A.R.A. glove from multiple angles
- Process diagrams for the "Technology" section
- 3D design renders for the "Design" section
  
### Video Content
A demonstration video needs to be created and added to the "Demo" section:

**Video Requirements:**
- 2-3 minute demonstration of the E-S.H.A.R.A. system in action
- Show both sign-to-speech and speech-to-sign functionalities
- Include captions for accessibility
- Upload to YouTube and embed using the provided video placeholder
- Replace the `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` in the JavaScript file with the actual YouTube video ID

### Community Credibility Section (IMPORTANT)
As discussed with Razan, a section on community credibility needs to be added. This section should:

- Showcase testimonials from members of the deaf community
- Include endorsements from sign language interpreters
- Feature feedback from relevant educational institutions
- Demonstrate how the project has been validated by the community it aims to serve

**Implementation Details:**
1. Add a new section after the "Demo" section with the ID `#community-validation`
2. Include 3-4 testimonial cards with quotes and photos
3. Consider adding logos of supporting organizations
4. Emphasize how community feedback has shaped the development process
